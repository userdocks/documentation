## Implementation in your web application

Add a single JavaScript file to your web application:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <button
      id="userdocks-sign-in-button"
      data-client-id="<your-userdocks-app-id>"
      data-redirect-uri="<https://your-web-app.com/callback>"
    >
      Login
    </button>
    <button
      id="userdocks-sign-up-button"
      data-client-id="<your-userdocks-app-id>"
      data-redirect-uri="<https://your-web-app.com/callback>"
    >
      Sign Up
    </button>
    <script src="https://sdk.userdocks.com/identity.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add buttons with the following attributes to your site:

- id: `html°userdocks-sign-in-button` and `html°userdocks-sign-up-button`
- data-client-id: `html°<your-userdocks-app-id>`
- data-redirect-uri: `html°<https://your-web-app.com/callback>`

Add the following javascript file to your site:

- JS: `html°<script src="https://sdk.userdocks.com/identity.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`

When a user on your web app clicks sign-up, it is redirected to a unique login page for your web application. After registration, confirming email address, and login the user will be redirected to your `data-redirect-uri`. Here you will need to exchange a code for an access and an id token.

Add the following code to your `html°data-redirect-uri`:

```js
// script on your callback-uri

// exchange the code for the tokens
const isLoginSuccess = await window.USERDOCKS.exchangeCodeForToken();
if (isLoginSuccess) {
  // redirect your user to your application
}

// else redirect it to the login page or elsewhere
```

Everytime a user makes a request to `userdocks` you would need to add the `access_token` to your HTTP headers, and you will use the `id_token` to verify the user on your own application backend. Every token is secured with a 512 bit secret. You will get a unique secret per application and you can use this secret to verify the `ìd_token` on your server, the `access_tokens` have another secret that is only known by our application (userdocks) so you will not be able to verify the signature on your own server.

```js
// get the tokens that are only stored in-memory and in another thread via a web worker
const {
  token_type,
  expires_in,
  redirect_uri,
  access_token,
  id_token,
} = await window.USERDOCKS.getToken();

// make a request to `userdocks` or your own server
// example url
await fetch('https://api.userdocks.com/api/v1/hello', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `${token_type} ${access_token}`, // or `${token_type} ${id_token}` if you make a request to your own server
  },
  // example data
  body: JSON.stringify({
    hello: 'world',
  }),
});
```

If the user is switching tabs, closing the browser and coming back to your site or simply reloading the site the `getToken` method will serve an empty token which will resolve in an error when tring to access private data on `userdocks` or your own server. There is a `silentRefresh` method, which will spawn an hidden iframe which tries to authenticate the user without the user having to enter any credientials. If there is an active session we will return the tokens, which you can use to redo the previous failed request, if the request fails again after the silent refresh you should redirect the user to the login page or elsewhere.

```js
// silently refresh, without any user action
await silentRefresh({
  client_id: '<your-userdocks-app-id>',
  redirect_uri: '<https://your-web-app.com/callback>',
  origin: '<https://your-web-app.com>',
});

// get the NEW tokens that are only stored in-memory and in another thread via a web worker
// this will only succeed if the user has checked the `keep me logged in` on the login page or the user has not closed the browser since the last login
const {
  token_type,
  expires_in,
  redirect_uri,
  access_token,
  id_token,
} = await window.USERDOCKS.getToken();

// RETRY the request to `userdocks` or your own server
// example url
await fetch('https://api.userdocks.com/api/v1/hello', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `${token_type} ${access_token}`, // or `${token_type} ${id_token}` if you make a request to your own server
  },
  // example data
  body: JSON.stringify({
    hello: 'world',
  }),
});

// if it successeds, continue as usual
// if the request fails again, you have to redirect the user to the login page or elsewhere
```
