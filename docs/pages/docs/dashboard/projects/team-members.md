Clicking on `Add team member` enables you to invite other users into a project.

There are two possible roles for a team member:

* admin - can read and write to the project
* user - can only read the project

If the admin checkbox is enabled you create a new admin for the project.

If you click on a Team member in the proejct overview you get to a team member detail page.

If you click on `Remove from project`, the user will be removed from the project.

If you enable or disable the admin checkbox, you can add or remove the team members admin role.
